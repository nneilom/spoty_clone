To see the project, you can use the command "npm run start."

The following features were implemented in the project, greatly enriching its functionality:

Authentication: We developed a complete authentication system, including registration (sign up), login, password reset, and password change. This ensures security and convenience for our users.

Comments and their display: We added the ability for users to leave comments and display them on the relevant pages. This allows users to share their thoughts, discuss content, and create an interactive community around the project.

Rating submission: We implemented a mechanism that allows users to submit ratings and evaluate content. This enables the assessment of popularity and quality of materials within the "Stopify" project.

Layout and design: Special attention was given to the project's layout to create an attractive and intuitive user interface. Visual design and element arrangement were carefully considered down to the smallest details to ensure a comfortable user experience.

Playlist management: We incorporated functionality that allows users to create and add playlists with music compositions. This enables users to customize personalized music streams according to their tastes and preferences.

Search functionality: We developed a search tool that enables users to easily find the desired content within the "Stopify" project. This significantly simplifies app navigation and enhances its usability.

CRUD participation (Create, Read, Update, Delete): We implemented functionality that enables users to create, view, update, and delete various elements within the project, contributing to a comprehensive user experience.

Certainly! In addition to that, we implemented an impressive player within the "Stopify" project. This player allows users to play music from playlists and control playback: play, pause, skip tracks, and adjust the volume. We paid special attention to the design of the player to make it visually appealing and intuitive for users. As a result, users can enjoy their favorite music and create their desired atmosphere within the "Stopify" project.
